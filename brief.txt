first checkout slack, then save config.py

to run:
$ source fffpu/bin/activate
$ python3 bot2.py
and wait for connection. terminal will print out errors, which mostly can be ignored.

go to your slack and click the plus sign next to apps and add fffpu. this opens up a chat with fffpu. send it an image, and see it download it to the images/ directory named by your username.
