to run:
$ python3 bot2.py
and wait for connection. terminal will print out errors, which mostly can be ignored.

go to your slack and click the plus sign next to apps and add fffpu. this opens up a chat with fffpu. send it an image, and see it download it to your directory.

however, this image is corrupted, and i've no idea how to fix it. i've tried different packages, different ways of downloading the image, but everything ends up corrupted.
